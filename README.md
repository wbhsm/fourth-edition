## What will you learn from this book?

Dive into C# and create apps, user interfaces, games, and more using this fun and highly visual introduction to C#, .NET Core, and Visual Studio. With this completely updated guide, which covers C# 8.0 and Visual Studio 2019, beginning programmers like you will build a fully functional game in the opening chapter. Then you'll learn how to use classes and object-oriented programming, create 3D games in Unity, and query data with LINQ. And you'll do it all by solving puzzles, doing hands-on exercises, and building real-world applications. By the time you're done, you'll be a solid C# programmer--and you'll have a great time along the way!

## What's so special about this book?

Based on the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory, Head First C# uses a visually rich format to engage your mind rather than a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. Why waste your time struggling with new concepts? This multisensory learning experience is designed for the way your brain really works.

***NOTE:** The downloadable projects for these chapters are **early release** PDFs! That means that while the code works, the projects are complete, and we've done our initial review of them, we're still working on polishing them up and putting the final touches on them. But you can definitely start using them today!**

## Did you run into trouble with the project in the first chapter?

In the first chaper you jump right into a project to create an animal matching game to help you start learning about C# and Visual Studio. We've had many readers do this project‚Äîso don't worry, it definitely works! (In fact, some of our readers got especially creative with the project. You can [read more about it on the Visual Studio blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/head-first-csharp-contest-got-some-truly-creative-entries/).)

While most readers are able to do this project without any trouble, you could run into problems if your code doesn't match the code in the book **exactly**. Here's what to do if you run into trouble with the project in the first chapter:
* Compare the code line by line. It's really easy to miss a comma, semicolon, parentheses, equals sign, etc.
* If you're following the WPF version, make sure that your XAML matches the XAML in the book **exactly**. If you're missing a TextBlock, you'll get an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.
* If you're following the ASP.NET Blazor version, make sure that your HTML markup matches the markup in the book **exactly**.

If you're still having trouble, watch the video walkthrough for the project on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnbMYjZgh6fSB6BBww1Wfbw/featured). It shows every step in the project so you can see exactly what you're supposed to do.

## Did you find an error in the book?

We worked really hard to make this book as error-free as possible! But we're only human, and we do occasionally make mistkaes. If you spot an error in the book, please use the [O'Reilly errata page](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=9781491976708) to let us know about it. That way it goes into a database so we can keep track of it and fix it in future printings.
